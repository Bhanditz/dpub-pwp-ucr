    <section id="introduction">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>The Web emerged in 1994, based on a model of individual pages loosely
          joined by hyperlinks. Clustering within domains and with explicit
          navigation elements built into them, webpages evolved into websites.
          This model inherited very little from an existing, powerful
          and much older page-based media: books.</p>

        <p>Over centuries, “books” have assumed many forms: journals, magazines,
          pamphlets of long-form articles and essays, newspapers, atlases, comics,
          notebooks, albums of all sorts. We can define these different
          manifestations as “publications”: bound editions of meaningful media,
          made public.</p>
        
        <p>Another form of publication that also has a long history in both the printed as well as the digital world are documents. These are publications that are written and distributed in a more ad-hoc manner, such as legal briefs, corporate memos, and even the definitions of standards, such as this content currently being read.</p>

        <p>We believe there is great value in combining this older tradition
          of portable, bounded publications with the pervasive accessibility,
          addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform (OWP). New
          models of economic sustainability, innovative experiences of knowledge
          and invigorated socio-cultural engagement depend on this.</p>

        <p>It is the task of this W3C Digital Publishing Interest Group to
          explore the uniqueness, desirability, and feasibility of bringing
          these two great models of publishing together. This document explores
          requirements based on examples of real world use cases and scenarios.
          The fundamental, baseline requirements that form the heart of what is
          expected from a PWP are described first, followed by requirements and
          use cases that describe additional, strongly desired scenarios.
          The complete list of requirements is also collected in a separate table in
          <a href="#req_list"></a>.

          <h2>Terminology</h2>
          <ul class="terms">
                <p><strong>EDITORS NOTE: We need to revise online/offline as discussed at TPAC</strong></p>
              <li>Online/Offline: The terms “online” and “offline” are used in this document, but the
              borderline between these is not always clear cut. For example, a PWP
              can be on a local disc but accessed through a web server running on
              that machine (i.e., through a <code>http://localhost</code> URL).
              The behavior of the client in this case is identical to the situation when the
              publication is genuinely online, although, technically, the
              publication is clearly offline. Similarly, a remote file system can be
              mounted as a local disc, in which case a PWP can be accessed as a file
              though technically online. A more precise terminology would use the
              terms like “protocol” and “file” states, for what is colloquially
              called “online” and “offline” in this document.</li>

              <li>This document uses the term “user agent”, as used by the Web community; see, for example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/work/wiki/Definition_of_User_Agent">WAI glossary entry</a>. The publishing community often uses the term “reading system” for roughly the same notion; while there may be subtle differences, it has been decided that it is better to stick to a single term for the purposes of this document.</li>

			  <li>Publication: A publication is a resource or collection of resources with
			  a persistent identity that enables interchange and reference.</li>

			  <li>Web Publication</li>

			  <li>Portable Web Publication: A subset of publications that are both
				portable and on the web.</li>

        <h1>PWP Fundamentals - Authors and Readers</h1>
        <section id="browser">
            <h3>Browser Readability</h3>
            <p class="req-set" id="r_browser">The publication should be readable in a browser.</p>

            <p>Reading publications of any length should not be restricted
            to specific devices or applications; publications should be equally
            available in a browser.</p>

          <ul class="use-cases">
                <li>Bob has some very specific plugins in his browser
                  that he enjoys using for a variety of purposes, including
                  creating annotations using his own annotation server, or
                  quickly copy and publish extracts in a specialized social
                  service. He wants to be able to read his textbook in this
                  environment, rather than being forced in to a special
                  application to read the text.</li>

                <li>Alice reads a scholarly paper that refers to large
                  datasets. The data can be presented interactively
                  through some very specialized data visualization
                  services relying on custom hardware on her computer.
                  These visualization services are incorporated into her
                  browser and can be used from within a web page. Alice
                  wants to make use of these while reading her paper to
                  gain a better understanding of the content.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id='pwp-owp'>
              <h3>Open Web Platform</h3>
            <p class="req-set" id="r_owp">PWPs should be able to make use of all features offered by the OWP.</p>

            <p>There is a remarkable development of tools and frameworks built on top of OWP that make it possible to develop powerful interactive layers on top of OWP. These include, for example, data visualization systems (e.g., d3, built on top of SVG), or possibilities to access external services like Wolfram Alfa. These tools have been traditionally developed for browsers, and provide possibilities that traditional publications should also benefit from. That requires publications to become first class citizens on the web platform.</p>

            <ul class="use-cases">
                <li>A large, multidisciplinary, web-based journal relies on
                traditional web technologies like HTML and CSS for its
                content. The journal, responding to the evolving
                expectations of its audience, is increasingly using
                additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics,
                and very large images; the trend is to consider these as
                integral parts of the scientific output. The journal as a
                result needs access to the latest visualization and other
                data management tools that the OWP-based tools can
                offer.</li>
                <!--(<a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Mike
                          Bostock’s recent article on visualizing
                          algorithms</a> or the “live” presentation of data

                          paper published by F1000 Research</a> are good
                          examples for the new possibilities.) -->

                <li>Educational publications are increasingly making use of OWP features. They include interactive exams (possibly linked to online evaluation facilities), visualization of data or of algorithms, built-in interpreters for various languages (e.g., for courses on programming); in many respects, the borderline between these publications and web applications is becoming fuzzy.</li>

                <li id="in_house_doc">BigBoxCo, a large technology company
                  with extensive "in-house" documentation to support the
                  technical and/or user documentation for their various
                  products and administrative processes, develops all this
                  material in digital-only formats. The quantity of
                  documentation makes it impractical to produce these documents
                  in print. Instead, the company publishes them
                  on the company intranet, and/or provides them to their
                  employees and contractors via specialized mobile devices.
                  These documents, as a type of publication, require 
                  accessibility, portability of annotations, and
                  the possible inclusion of complex media.</li>

          <h3>Pagination</h3>
            <p class="req-set" id="r_pag">It should be possible to see the publication in a “paginated” view.</p>

            <p>Whereas a “scrolling” view is the dominating approach on
              the Web in browsers, publications should provide the
              possibility to switch to a paginated view if the user so
              desires or as the author suggests. Pagination may
              automatically adapt page sizes to the device’s or the
              browser’s viewport, and may contain separate headers,
              footers, and/or page numbers.

                  her progress in the book and to make navigation within

            <p>Accessing a document online or offline should not require
            conversions from one storage format to the other. The
            transition should be as transparent as possible to the

            interaction from her part. </p>

                the train to her university. Her review process includes the
                creation of annotations, notes, highlights, and possibly
                changes on the content itself. These annotations and changes
                must be smoothly transferred back to the server of the

                this time, Klaas frequently alternates between reading
                on his portable device, which may or may be
                online, and reading on his desktop. Ensuring a smooth

            <p>Preserving essential content is the job of the reading
            system. However, having a clear indication within the
            publication format to mark which items are critical, and
            which instead need a fallback for limited
            connectivity/storage situations, would provide critical
            input to the user agent to do it's job. This would also
            give more control to the publisher, allowing them to ensure
            a consistent user experience while consuming the
            publication. When changing the state of a PWP
            from, e.g., online to offline, an implementation knows which
            PWP resources are essential for the display of the content,
            and therefore must be included in the offline version, or
            which may be skipped (see <a
            href="#fundamental-online-offline"></a> and <a
            href="#fundamental-transition"></a>)</p>

            <p>Non-essential content, which is not required to be available in certain
             states, should have a predefined fallback that will
             allow the user to continue consumption (even in a
             potentially degraded, but author-controlled manner)
             (see also <a href="#states"></a>).</p>

            <ul class="use-cases">

                Nick is reading a long-form narrative: a publication
                filled with text, images, sounds, and multimedia files.
                Nick is also a multi-device user who wishes to consume
                the publication on multiple devices. Some of those
                devices have limited storage, and some of them have
                limited connectivity. Nick also rides the subway, where
                he loses Internet connectivity frequently and without
                warning for long stretches of time. During offline or
                low-storage situations, there are still critical parts of the
                publication that are consumable, mainly the text (and
                possibly images). Having a reasonable fallback for video,
                such as a poster image or placeholder image, would allow Nick
                to read the content while offline or on a device with
                limited storage.

                space by only storing essential content for his graphic
                novels. It is up to the user agent to support different
                behaviors for essential versus non-essential content,
                ensuring that an entire package only downloaded when necessary.

                essential to add that font to the set of
                resources that are made available offline.</li>

              <li>A font used for aesthetic purposes only in display of a

                not be for Nick who has indicated the images are, to him,

            independence, security, and privacy. (These are usually

            <dl>
                <dt>Accessibility:</dt>
                <dd>People with disabilities should be able to access
                  the content of a publication. They should be able to perceive,
                  understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well
                  as contribute to it. Accessibility encompasses all
                  disabilities that affect access to the content,
                  including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive,
                  and neurological disabilities.</dd>

                <dt>Internationalization:</dt>
                <dd>Publications should be well adapted to any language,
                  writing systems, region, or culture. This includes the
                  usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left,
                  horizontal or vertical writing; item numbering, or
                  interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of
                  the right character sets and of local typographic conventions.</dd>

                <dt>Device Independence:</dt>
                <dd>The content in a publication should be usable on a large number of devices
                  with very different device characteristics: different
                  screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying
                  level of processing power, etc. These different affordances
                  should be automatic with no, or very little, user intervention.</dd>

                <dt>Security:</dt>
                <dd>Publications should be presented by a User Agent using a security model that is at least (if not more) secure than the standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/runtime/">web security model</a>. Doing will prevent publications that contain malicious attacks,
                data theft, and other security incidents from impacting users by jeopardizing the integrity of the underlying data or machine operations.</dd>

                <dt>Privacy:</dt>
                <dd>The content in a publication should maintain and support user privacy,
                  in spite of the fact that the evolution of online
                  technologies has increased the possibility for the
                  collection and processing of personal, and possibly
                  sensitive, data. However, since a publication may use <a href="#pwp-owp">any part of the OWP</a>, it may choose to use  functionality such as the ability to
                  track a user's activity within the publication.</dd>

            <p>These principles correspond to technical requirements on
              the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and its possible
              extension for PWP) insofar as the technologies must
              empower the authors (writers, editors, publishers,
              etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether
              authors use the possibilities of these technologies or
              not is not addressed in this document.</p>

            <p>All these constraints are formalized in the
              context of the usage on the Web and by extension Web Publications.
                This means that they are valid

              they are online or offline, or whether the publication
              is distributed as a single unit or not. 
                In some cases, for example due to legislative reasons,
              the demands on publications may be more stringent
              than for generic web sites. The use cases below provide

            the list of constituent resources and some of their
            characteristics such as whether they are essential, and their media types and sizes.
          </p>
            
            <p>In a publication, some content is essential to the user being able to consume it while other content could be either absent or have a provided fallback for situations such as limited
            connectivity or storage. This information, provided by the author or publisher of the PWP, would enable a user agent to provide a better experience to the user. 
                For exanple, the user agent can ensure that essential resources are made available when offline (see <a href="#fundamental-online-offline"></a>.</p>

        <h1>States of a PWP</h1>

        <p> During the consumption of a publication, a user may change the “state” of
          their PWP. The states of a PWP reflects whether the document is online or
          offline, or whether it is packed (i.e., all constituents are packaged, for example, in a
          ZIP file) or not. These different states require a different behavior from the
          user agent, while some of the characteristics of the publication may be
          invariant across states. The table below shows the same publication (PWP) in the
          most typical states: </p>

        <h1>Archiving</h1>

        <p>We take for granted the relative durability of print artifacts, many of
        which have survived with little more than benign neglect. In contrast, digital
        documents are unlikely to persist without more active interventions, such as
        making copies, monitoring software dependencies, and validating integrity.
        Since future consumers of publications represent the most open-ended user
        group, it is desirable that digital documents be instilled with more of the
        inherent durability that characterizes print artifacts. The PWP offers this
        potential, by making it easier for archiving services to locate, harvest,
        update, and describe digital publications. Long-term preservation of digital
        publications ensures that they may continue to be accessible, beyond the
        tenure of individual authors, file formats, publishers, or publishing
        platforms.</p>

Fortunately, the teacher can safely read the PWP on the web because the school's classroom service has automatically stripped the document of all untrusted scripts.</li>

                <span class="req-set" id="r_sec-discovery">It should be possible to discover the capabilities a PWP will have access to.</span> A document’s access to features and APIs will vary from platform to platform, app to app. Document authors benefit from being able to discover these capabilities.

            <ul class="use-cases">
                <li>Luke has written a nonfiction book on web development. To discover
                which APIs he can demonstrate directly in the PWP and which he cannot, he
                uses a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/permissions/" title="W3C -
                Permissions">permissions API</a> combined with feature detection to let
                the text discover what capabilities it has access to at each read.

                graceful degradation that the author should be able to use to safely
                create their documents.</li>

                <li>Jill has written a detailed data analysis report for her manager that
                uses complex interactive graphs to display the results. These graphs work
                in the manager’s user agent because the script driving them uses a
                previously specified ‘always safe’ API subset that user agent’s have
                committed to enabling even when the capabilities of the document are
                otherwise limited, e.g. for security.</li>

                <li>Jack has written an interactive children’s book. Because he has
                followed published guidelines on how to make texts that progressively
                enhance or gracefully degrade, all of his readers can experience the text,
                even if they don’t have access to all the features, all the time.</li>

            <p>
                <span class="req-set" id="r_sec-integrity">PWP authors should be able to embed guidance policies in their documents that inform the user agent of their preferences as to how the integrity and security of the document itself should be preserved.</span> Indeed, scripted documents are dynamic by nature; long-lived authored documents are vulnerable to alteration by a variety of external factors. This mechanism should be based on the pre-existing Content Security Policy (CSP)&nbsp;[[csp2]] and Subresource Integrity&nbsp;[[sri]] specifications and not be a new invention incompatible with web browser CSP implementations. </p>

            <ul class="use-cases">
                  <li>Jill’s data analysis report used an externally hosted script to
                  generate her interactive graphs. To ensure that these scripts do not
                  violate her manager’s privacy, she includes a CSP whitelist in the
                  document that tells the User Agent that it should only load that external
                  script and not any of the third party services the script wants to load as
                  well.</li>

                  <li>After Jill’s report has been in the archive for a year, Simon, the
                  manager, wants to revisit the analysis for his own end-of-year report. But
                  because the domain for the external web service has lapsed, it has been
                  taken over by a malicious actor who replaced its scripted graphs with
                  graphs that display random numbers and nonsense. But because Jill’s
                  authoring system used Subresource Integrity attributes the User Agent
                  refuses to load the malware and instead the document degrades gracefully
                  to showing static—correct—graphs.</li>
