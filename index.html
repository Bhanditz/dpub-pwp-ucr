    <section id="introduction">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>The Web emerged in 1994, based on a model of individual pages loosely
          joined by hyperlinks. Clustering within domains and with explicit
          navigation elements built into them, webpages evolved into websites.
          This model inherited very little from an existing, powerful
          and much older page-based media: books.</p>

        <p>Over centuries, “books” have assumed many forms: journals, magazines,
          pamphlets of long-form articles and essays, newspapers, atlases, comics,
          notebooks, albums of all sorts. We can define these different
          manifestations as “publications”: bound editions of meaningful media,
          made public.</p>

        <p>We believe there is great value in combining this older tradition
          of portable, bounded publications with the pervasive accessibility,
          addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform (OWP). New
          models of economic sustainability, innovative experiences of knowledge
          and invigorated socio-cultural engagement depend on this.</p>

        <p>It is the task of this W3C Digital Publishing Interest Group to
          explore the uniqueness, desirability, and feasibility of bringing
          these two great models of publishing together. This document explores
          requirements based on examples of real world use cases and scenarios.
          The fundamental, baseline requirements that form the heart of what is
          expected from a PWP are described first, followed by requirements and
          use cases that describe additional, strongly desired scenarios.
          The complete list of requirements is also collected in a separate table in
          <a href="#req_list"></a>.

          <h2>Terminology</h2>
          <p>
              The terms “online” and “offline” are used in this document, but the
              borderline between these is not always clear cut. For example, a PWP
              can be on a local disc but accessed through a web server running on
              that machine (i.e., through a <code>http://localhost</code> URL).
              The behavior of the client in this case is identical to the situation when the
              publication is genuinely online, although, technically, the
              publication is clearly offline. Similarly, a remote file system can be
              mounted as a local disc, in which case a PWP can be accessed as a file
              though technically online. A more precise terminology would use the
              terms like “protocol” and “file” states, for what is colloquially
              called “online” and “offline” in this document.

            <h3>Browser Readability</h3>
            <p class="req-set" id="r_browser">The publication should be readable in a browser.</p>

            <p>Reading publications of any length should not be restricted
            to specific devices or applications; publications should be equally
            available in a browser.</p>

          <ul class="use-cases">
                <li>Bob has some very specific plugins in his browser
                  that he enjoys using for a variety of purposes, including
                  creating annotations using his own annotation server, or
                  quickly copy and publish extracts in a specialized social
                  service. He wants to be able to read his textbook in this
                  environment, rather than being forced in to a special
                  application for the purpose of that specific
                  publication</li>

                <li>Alice reads a scholarly paper that refers to large
                  datasets. The data can be presented interactively
                  through some very specialized data visualization
                  services relying on custom hardware on her computer.
                  These visualization services are incorporated into her
                  browser and can be used from within a web page. Alice
                  wants to make use of these while reading her paper to
                  gain a better understanding of the content.</li>

              <h3>Open Web Platform</h3>
            <p class="req-set" id="r_owp">PWPs should be able to make use of all facilities offered by the OWP.</p>

            <p>There is a formidable development of visualization systems,
              interactive tools, and other powerful facilities that are
              built on top of the OWP, including accessing
              external services like Wolfram Alfa. These tools have
              been traditionally developed for browsers, and provide
              possibilities that traditional publications, such as books,
              magazines, scholarly papers, and educational materials,
              should also benefit from. That requires publications to
              become first class citizens on the web platform. </p>

            <ul class="use-cases">
                <li>A large, multidisciplinary, web-based journal relies on
                traditional web technologies like HTML and CSS for its
                content. The journal, responding to the evolving
                expectations of its audience, is increasingly using
                additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics,
                and very large images; the trend is to consider these as
                integral parts of the scientific output. The journal as a
                result needs access to the latest visualization and other
                data management tools that the OWP-based tools can
                offer.</li>

                <li>Educational materials are increasingly making use
                  of OWP facilities. They include
                  runnable program snippets, interactive testing tools
                  (linked to online evaluation facilities); in many
                  respects, the borderline between these publications
                  and web applications is becoming fuzzy.</li>

                <li id="in_house_doc">BigBoxCo, a large technology company
                  with extensive "in-house" documentation to support the
                  technical and/or user documentation for their various
                  products and administrative processes, develops all this
                  material in digital-only formats. The quantity of
                  documentation makes it impractical to produce these documents
                  in print. Instead, the company publishes them
                  on the company intranet, and/or provides them to their
                  employees and contractors via specialized mobile devices.
                  The production of these documents has similar
                  challenges to scholarly publications including issues around
                  accessibility, portability of annotations, and
                  the possible inclusion of complex media.</li>

            <p>Whereas a “scrolling” view is the dominating approach on
              the Web in Web browsers, publications must provide the
              possibility to switch to a paginated view if the user so
              desires or as the author suggests. Pagination may
              automatically adapt page sizes to the device’s or the
              browser’s viewport, and may contain separate headers,
              footers, and/or page numbers.

            <p class="req-set" id="r_essential">There should be a way to differentiate between essential and non-essential resources.</p>

            <p>Preserving essential content is the job of the reading
            system. However, having a clear indication within the
            publication format to mark which items are critical, and
            which instead need a fallback for limited
            connectivity/storage situations, would provide critical
            input to the reading system to do it's job. This would also
            give more control to the publisher, allowing them to ensure
            a consistent user experience while consuming the
            publication. When changing the state of a PWP
            from, e.g., online to offline, an implementation knows which
            PWP resources are essential for the display of the content,
            and therefore must be included in the offline version, or
            which may be skipped (see <a
            href="#fundamental-online-offline"></a> and <a
            href="#fundamental-transition"></a>)</p>

            <p>Non-essential content, which is not required to be available in certain
             states, should have a predefined fallback that will
             allow the user to continue consumption (even in a
             potentially degraded, but author-controlled manner)
             (see also <a href="#states"></a>).</p>

            <ul class="use-cases">
              <li>
                Nick is reading a long-form narrative: a publication
                filled with text, images, sounds, and multimedia files.
                Nick is also a multi-device user who wishes to consume
                the publication on multiple devices. Some of those
                devices have limited storage, and some of them have
                limited connectivity. Nick also rides the subway, where
                he loses Internet connectivity frequently and without
                warning for long stretches of time. During offline or
                low-storage situations, there are still critical parts of the
                publication that are consumable, mainly the text (and
                possibly images). Having a reasonable fallback for video,
                such as a poster image or placeholder image, would allow Nick
                to read the content while offline or on a device with
                limited storage.

                situation and may want to locally store the entire (even
                non-essential) contents of his textbooks. He will save
                space by only storing essential content for his graphic
                novels. It is up to the reading system to support different
                behaviors for essential versus non-essential content,
                ensuring that an entire package only downloaded when necessary.

                essential to add that font to the set of
                resources that are made available offline.</li>

              <li>A font used for aesthetic purposes only in display of a

                not be for Nick who has indicated the images are, to him,
                nonessential.</li>

                for conveying the results of the paper and therefore
                indicates it should be skipped when he reads the publication
                offline. </li>

            <p>Web content has to be consumed under different
            circumstances: it must be available to the largest
            possible audience in a secure manner, providing the
            necessary protection of the reader’s privacy. Publication
            content must be able to answer to a number of principles
            like accessibility, internationalization, device
            independence, security, and privacy. (These are usually
            referred to, in the W3C context, as “horizontal”
            dependencies.) These principles are, in general terms:
            </p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Accessibility:</dt>
                <dd>People with disabilities should be able to access
                  the content; they should be able to perceive,
                  understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well
                  as contribute to it. Accessibility encompasses all
                  disabilities that affect access to the content,
                  including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive,
                  and neurological disabilities.</dd>

                <dt>Internationalization:</dt>
                <dd>Publications should be well adapted to any language,
                  writing systems, region, or culture. This includes the
                  usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left,
                  horizontal or vertical writing; item numbering, or
                  interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of
                  the right character sets and of local typographic conventions.</dd>

                <dt>Device Independence:</dt>
                <dd>Content should be usable on a large number of devices
                  with very different device characteristics: different
                  screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying
                  level of processing power, etc. These different affordances
                  should be automatic with no, or very little user intervention.</dd>

                <dt>Security:</dt>
                <dd>Publications should prevent malicious attacks,
                data theft, and other security incidents, even if
                they contain secure mashups, access to distributed
                services, etc. Consuming the content should not
                jeopardize the integrity of the underlying data,
                users’ privacy, or machine operations.</dd>

                <dt>Privacy:</dt>
                <dd>Content should maintain and support user privacy,
                  in spite of the fact that the evolution of online
                  technologies has increased the possibility for the
                  collection and processing of personal, and possibly
                  sensitive, data, as well as the ability to ubiquitously
                  track a user's online activity.</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>These principles correspond to technical requirements on
              the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and its possible
              extension for PWP) insofar as the technologies must
              empower the authors (writers, editors, publishers,
              etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether
              authors use the possibilities of these technologies or
              not is not addressed in this document.</p>

            <p>All these constraints are usually formalized in the
              context of the usage on the Web, but they are also valid
              for publications in general regardless of whether
              they are online or offline, or whether the publication
              is distributed as a single unit or not. In some cases,
              for example due to legislative reasons,
              the demands on digital publications may be more stringent
              than for generic web sites. The use cases below provide
              some examples for the publication-specific situations.

        <h1>Manifests</h1>

        <p>In this document, 'manifest' refers to an abstract place,
        typically one or several files, that contain information necessary to the
        proper management, rendering, and so on, of the publication. This is opposed to
        metadata that contain information on the content of the
        publication like author, publication date, and so on.</p>

        <p>Some fundamental use cases and requirements already imply the usage of manifests. For example:</p>
        <ul>

              <p>A user agent requires information about the package and its components
              in order to process it. For example, performance and memory requirements may
              prevent a user agent from parsing a large number of content documents in
              order to discover the necessary components and their relationships. A user
              agent may need to make some decisions about how to present content before
              displaying it.</p>

              <p>Some necessary features are listed among the fundamental features of a
              PWP (see <a href="#find-information"></a>); the use cases below provide a

                <li>A user agent may not be able to process files beyond a certain size
                due to bandwidth, storage or memory limitations, or processing time
                expectations; this information should be available in
                advance.</li>

                <li>A user agent should be able to process permissions and rights
                information for each component identified in the package. For example,
                it needs to know whether it has the rights to place an image of the Mona
                Lisa owned by the Louvre in a package to be downloaded offline.</li>

                <li>A user agent should be able to determine if captions are available
                for multimedia resources within the publication.</li>

                <li>For further processing the user agent needs to have access to

        <p>We take for granted the relative durability of print artifacts, many of
        which have survived with little more than benign neglect. In contrast, digital
        documents are unlikely to persist without more active interventions, such as
        making copies, monitoring software dependencies, and validating integrity.
        Since future consumers of publications represent the most open-ended user
        group, it is desirable that digital documents be instilled with more of the
        inherent durability that characterizes print artifacts. The PWP offers this
        potential, by making it easier for archiving services to locate, harvest,
        update, and describe digital publications. Long-term preservation of digital
        publications ensures that they may continue to be accessible, beyond the
        tenure of individual authors, file formats, publishers, or publishing
        platforms.</p>
